# odin_tic_tac_toe
This project is about creating the board game Tic Tac Toe using OOP.
It demonstrates that I've learned how to:
- Create a class.
- Create instance methods, instance variables.
- Create an instance.
- Use loop.
- Use conditionals.

If there's any mistake or anything I could improve please let me know. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
